# Demisstify

This project aims to help general populace by providing a portal to register a complaint of
missing and found people without having to go to police station. This application provides an easy to use
web interface where a person can upload the details of the person missing or found. The application
stores the data in the database and whenever a new complaint is registered the application searches for
the matching image in the database and stores the matching profiles in the database. If the match is
found the admin will be assigned to confirm whether the matching is correct or not, once the admin
approves of the match the complainant will be informed about it for further actions.
